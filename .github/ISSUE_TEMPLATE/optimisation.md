**Type of optimisation**
Could I improve a function? Have I completely forgotten about consistency? I'm trying to keep my code as readable and as friendly as possible, so also describe how this affected readability.

**Snippet of code**
Where did this occur?

**Potential solutions**
How could this be fixed (if you know how to)?
